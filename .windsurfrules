- Always use latest available version of packages.
- Use PNPM instead of NPM.
- Never auto-install packages without my confirmation.

## Global rules

- Focus only on changes you mentioned, do NOT over-interpret.

## Coding

- Never generic anemic models.

### Before coding

- Before proposing code change, please take a look at the version used!
- When creating a feature, always:
  - Generate a plan overview of what you are going to do.
  - Print the lib versions explicitly to make sure you are on the right one.
  - Check officiel documentation.

### After coding

- Always check if the code follows best practices.
- Assert there is no duplicate code or dead code.
- When finishing a feature, always:
  - Check what you did according to best practices
  - Check in the online documentation that you did it correctly
  - Check if everything is working as expected but running check commands

### Comments

- Never comment code, except when needed for:
  - Complexe logic
  - Interfaces
  - Configuration

## Frontend rules

- Do not use "Jest", we choose to use "Vitest" instead.

## Backend rules

- Use types generated from Prisma when looking for database typing.
