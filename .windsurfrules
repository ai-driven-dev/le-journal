### Before coding

- Before proposing code change, please take a look at the version used!
- When creating a feature, always:
  - Generate a plan overview of what you are going to do.
  - Print the lib versions explicitly to make sure you are on the right one.
  - Check officiel documentation.

### After coding

- Always check if the code follows best practices.
- Assert there is no duplicate code or dead code.
- When finishing a feature, always:
  - Check what you did according to best practices
  - Check in the online documentation that you did it correctly
  - Check if everything is working as expected but running check commands

### Comments

- Never comment code, except when needed for:
  - Complexe logic
  - Interfaces
  - Configuration

## Frontend rules

- Test with Vitest.
- Use "Vite" instead of "Webpack".

- DDD and clean architecture for backend.
- Prisma types are used for entities.

### Backend tests

- Prisma uses its own migrations in tests-migrations.
- Prisma uses its own sqlite in tests, migrations are played when starting tests.
