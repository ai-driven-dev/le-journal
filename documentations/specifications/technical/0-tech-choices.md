- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) → Focus on business-driven architecture using Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects, Repositories, and Services to enforce domain consistency.
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) → When working on user stories, test files, or Gherkin scenarios, focus on real-world user behavior to drive system design.
- SOLID Principles → Maintain single responsibility, modularity, and decoupling to ensure long-term maintainability and flexibility.
