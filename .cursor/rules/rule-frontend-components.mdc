Frontend Components:
- Apply the Smart/Dumb pattern: 
    - Smart components (stateful, using MobX stores)
    - Dumb components (pure UI).
- Organize by feature in folders.
Example for a user profile component:
```text
user-profile/
| user-profile.component.tsx # minimal logic, only UI component
| user-profile-menu.component.tsx # minimal logic, only UI component
| user-profile.store.ts # for actions, computed, reactions...
| user-profile.hook.ts # if necessary
| user-profile.context.ts # if necessary, for providers
| user-profile.mock.ts # test data for UI
| user-profile.type.ts # for store types: state, actions...
```
- All actions, computations, and transformations (such as filtering, must be stored in variables at the top of the file (expect for className).
  - Do not over-interprate, e.g. this code in not necessary `const shouldShowContent = hasArticles; const articles = email.articles;`

State Management (MobX)
- Use mobx-react-lite and makeAutoObservable.
- Use runInAction for async or reactive effects.
- Use computed properties for derived state and actions for modifications.
- Create a factory at the bottom of each store (e.g. `export const createProjectStore = (): ProjectStore => new ProjectStore();`)
- Inject the store into the parent component to facilitate state management.
