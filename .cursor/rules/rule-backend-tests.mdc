Backend tests rules:
- Jest for testing.
- Integration tests must not create data directly (use seed.ts).
- No "retries".

Backend tests (integration):
- Always test controller to have the max coverrage.

Backend tests with data:
- Seed are used as fixtures, data already set up.
- Never call Prisma directly in tests, use repository if needed.
